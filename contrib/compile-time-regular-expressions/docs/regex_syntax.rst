Regex Syntax
============

The library supports most of the `PCRE <pcre.org>`_ syntax with a few exceptions:

- atomic groups
- boundaries other than ^$
- callouts
- character properties
- comments
- conditional patterns
- control characters (\\cX)
- horizontal / vertical character classes (\\h\\H\\v\\V)
- match point reset (\\K)
- named characters
- octal numbers
- options / modes
- subroutines
- unicode grapheme cluster (\\X)
